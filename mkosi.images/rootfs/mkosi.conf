# that handles booting far enough to mount this image over the USB network.

[Output]
# Output a directory so that we can easily scoop out the kernel + modules
# for the main UKI build, and then build an erofs from this directory.

# mkosi 25.3 doesn't properly handle firmware when filtering kmods.
# As a result, WCN3990 blobs get shuffled out of the image no matter what
# (because ath10k driver isn't declaring them in its modinfo)
# The next release should include a FirmwareFiles= to address this.
